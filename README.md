# Undergraduate Projects

This repository hosts three comprehensive projects that I completed during my undergraduate studies in Mathematics at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. Each project is documented in RMarkdown, offering detailed insights into their objectives and methodologies. Further information about each project can be found below.

## Bayesian Statistics Project
A collaborative project with colleague Petros Koutsis, exploring the core principles of Bayesian data analysis. This project is structured into two integral components. The first phase focuses on the theoretical underpinnings, involving the derivation of posterior distributions under various prior specifications. The second phase delves into the computational aspects, including the investigation of Credible Intervals and the application of the Gibbs Sampler methodology.

## Mathematical Statistics Project
A collaborative project with Dr Samis Trevezas with the aim to detect and estimate the power of nuclear weapons using Multidimensional Maximum Likelihood Estimation. Our project involved the development and implementation of two conditional maximization solutions in the R programming language. Furthermore, we rigorously validated our findings by employing a custom Newton-Raphson algorithm.

## exercise6
Successfully solved Exercise 6 from 'Bayesian Data Analysis' by Gelman et al. (Page 80). In this project, I conducted Bayesian Inference to estimate the parameters of a Binomial distribution (probability of success & sample size), in cases where both of these parameters were unknown.
